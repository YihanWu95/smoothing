# Completing the Picture: Randomized Smoothing Suffers fromCurse of Dimensionality for a Large Family of Distributions
This repository contains code for the paper Completing the Picture: Randomized Smoothing Suffers fromCurse of Dimensionality for a Large Family of Distributions by Yihan Wu, Aleksandar Bojchevski, Aleksei Kuvshinov and Stephan GÃ¼nnemann. The code is forked from the publicly-available code from the paper Certified Adversarial Robustness via Randomized Smoothing by (Cohen et al. 2019).

Our main contribution, the algorithm for calculating the r_x, is in the code/core.py, where we implement a new class called Gaussian.
